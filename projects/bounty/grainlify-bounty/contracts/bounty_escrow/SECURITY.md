# Security Audit Preparation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Bounty Escrow contract and serves as a checklist for security audits.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Reentrancy Protection
- **Mechanism**: A boolean flag `ReentrancyGuard` is stored in the contract instance storage.
- **Coverage (Bounty Escrow)**: All state-modifying public functions (`lock_funds`, `release_funds`, `refund`, `batch_lock_funds`, `batch_release_funds`) are protected.
- **Coverage (Program Escrow)**: Core state-modifying functions (`lock_program_funds`, `batch_payout`, `single_payout`) are reviewed for reentrancy risks and follow checks-effects-interactions with no internal callbacks.
- **Behavior**: If reentrancy is detected, the contract panics, reverting the transaction.

### 2. Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern
- **Bounty Escrow**: State updates (e.g., setting status to `Released`, `Refunded`, or `PartiallyRefunded`) are performed *before* any external token transfers in both single and batch flows.
- **Program Escrow**: State updates to `ProgramData` (balances and payout history) are performed before token transfers; batch flows are atomic within a single transaction.
- **Goal**: Prevent reentrancy attacks where an external call calls back into the contract before the state is updated.

### 3. Input Sanitization
- **Amount**: Validated to be strictly positive (`> 0`) and within remaining balances for escrow/program payouts.
- **Deadline**: Validated to be in the future during `lock_funds` and to gate refunds in `refund`.
- **Access Control**: Strict checks for `admin`, `depositor`, `authorized_payout_key`, and anti-abuse admin signatures where appropriate.

### 4. Access Control & Upgrade Safety
- **Grainlify Core**:
  - Single-admin upgrade path uses `admin.require_auth()` and immutable admin after initialization.
  - Multisig upgrade path (`MultiSig`) enforces signer sets, thresholds, and executed flags to prevent replay.
- **Program Escrow**:
  - `authorized_payout_key.require_auth()` enforced on all payout functions.
  - Rate limiting and whitelisting protect high-frequency callers.
- **Bounty Escrow**:
  - Admin-only release and approval flows, depositor-guarded locking, and dual-auth refund triggers (admin and depositor).

## Known Risks and Limitations

### Dual-Authorization Refund (Bounty Escrow)
- **Description**: The `refund` function requires authenticated authorization from both the contract `admin` and the escrow `depositor`.
- **Rationale**: This enforces explicit co-approval for automated refund execution while preserving refund safety and existing eligibility checks.
- **Risk**: Low to medium operationally. Unauthorized third parties cannot trigger refunds, but coordination between admin and depositor is required for execution.

### Admin Privileges & Upgrades
- **Description**:
  - Bounty Escrow `release_funds` and refund approvals require `admin` authorization.
  - Program Escrow payouts require `authorized_payout_key` authorization.
  - Grainlify Core upgrades require either single-admin auth or a multisig proposal that reaches threshold.
- **Risk**: If a privileged key is compromised, funds can be misdirected or upgrades abused.
- **Mitigation**: All privileged keys should be backed by multi-sig or secure backend services, and upgrade hashes should be audited before use.

## Audit Checklist (Bounty Escrow)

- [ ] Verify Reentrancy Guards on all state-modifying paths (`lock_funds`, `release_funds`, `refund`, `batch_lock_funds`, `batch_release_funds`).
- [ ] Confirm Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is strictly followed (state update before token transfers).
- [ ] Review Access Control logic for `release_funds` and `approve_refund` (admin only).
- [ ] Review Access Control logic for `lock_funds` and batch locking (depositor signatures and auth aggregation).
- [ ] Verify Arithmetic safety (overflow/underflow protection via Rust/Soroban defaults and bounds checks on remaining amounts).
- [ ] Test edge cases:
   - Zero/negative amount
   - Past deadline
   - Double release
   - Double/over-refund
   - Reentrancy attempts across single and batch flows

## Audit Checklist (Program Escrow)

- [ ] Verify that `initialize_program` can only be called once per deployment.
- [ ] Confirm `authorized_payout_key.require_auth()` on `batch_payout` and `single_payout`.
- [ ] Check that payout loops validate:
   - Non-empty recipients/amounts
   - Matching vector lengths
   - Positive amounts
   - No overflow when summing total payout
- [ ] Verify remaining balance invariants after payouts and locking.
- [ ] Review anti-abuse configuration (rate limits, whitelists, admin auth).
- [ ] Exercise edge cases:
   - Insufficient remaining balance
   - Maximum reasonable batch sizes
   - Re-initialization attempts and pre-init calls.

## Audit Checklist (Grainlify Core & MultiSig)

- [ ] Confirm `init` and `init_admin` are single-use and prevent re-initialization.
- [ ] Verify that only configured signers can propose and approve multisig upgrades.
- [ ] Check threshold validation and execution flags to prevent double-execution or replay.
- [ ] Review `upgrade` and `execute_upgrade` flows for:
   - Correct admin/multisig authorization
   - No unexpected state resets
   - Proper version tracking via `set_version`.
- [ ] Validate monitoring data and events are non-mutating and safe for off-chain observability.

## Gas Optimization & Cost Analysis (All Contracts)

- **Compiler Profiles**: All contracts build with Soroban-optimized release settings (`opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, overflow checks enabled at workspace level).
- **Batch Operations**:
  - Bounty Escrow: `batch_lock_funds` and `batch_release_funds` reduce per-bounty overhead and share token client / storage lookups.
  - Program Escrow: `batch_payout` distributes to many recipients in a single transaction with linear complexity in recipient count.
- **Storage Access Patterns**:
  - Escrow records and program data are read once, updated in-memory, and written back once per operation.
  - Duplicate-ID checks are bounded by `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (100) and intended for operational safety over micro-optimizations.
- **Per-Function Gas Classification (relative)**:
  - **Low**: View functions (`get_escrow_info`, `get_balance`, `get_program_info`, `get_remaining_balance`, `get_version`, monitoring getters).
  - **Medium**: Single escrow/program mutations with one token transfer (`lock_funds`, `release_funds`, `refund` partial/custom cases, `single_payout`, `init_admin`, `set_version`).
  - **High**: Batch flows and upgrades (`batch_lock_funds`, `batch_release_funds`, `batch_payout`, `execute_upgrade`, `upgrade`).
- **Benchmarking Guidance**: To measure concrete gas usage per operation, build in release mode and benchmark invocations with the Stellar CLI and Soroban profiling tools in CI or local environments, using the relative classifications above as a baseline.

## Verification
- **Automated Tests**: All security tests passed, including invalid amount, invalid deadline, and reentrancy checks.
- **Manual Review**: Codebase reviewed for CEI compliance and gas characteristics as described above.
