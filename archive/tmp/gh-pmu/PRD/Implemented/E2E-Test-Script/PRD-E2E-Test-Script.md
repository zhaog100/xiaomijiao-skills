# PRD: E2E Test Script

**Status:** Complete
**Created:** 2026-01-17
**Source Proposal:** Proposal/PROPOSAL-E2E-Test-Script.md

---

## Overview

This PRD defines the implementation of a Go-based end-to-end (E2E) test suite that validates complete workflows against a dedicated test project. The tests target commands that are difficult to unit test due to external process calls, complex state management, and API interactions.

**Key Benefits:**
- Coverage contribution via `go test -tags=e2e -cover`
- Windows, macOS, Linux support (native Go cross-platform)
- Catches API bugs (would have caught issue #551 batch mutation bug)
- Validates untested workflow commands (microsprint, branch, board, filter)
- Pre-merge gate integration with release commands

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Test Project: #41 (IDPF-gh-pmu-testing) - Private
- Test Repo: `rubrical-works/gh-pmu-e2e-test` - Private

## Technical Notes

> Implementation hints, not requirements. Do not create issues from this section.

### Test Execution
- Sequential execution only (no `t.Parallel()`) to avoid shared resource conflicts
- Binary built once in `TestMain`, reused across all tests
- Temp directories for config isolation per test

### Project Field Verification
- Tests verify required fields exist (Status, Priority, Release, Microsprint)
- Fields must be created via `gh pmu init` on test project beforehand
- Tests fail fast if fields missing

### Coverage Integration
- Binary built with `-cover` flag for instrumentation
- Coverage data written to `GOCOVERDIR` directory
- Merge with unit test coverage via `go tool covdata textfmt`

### E2E Coverage Map (for impact analysis)
```
cmd/microsprint → test/e2e/microsprint_test.go
cmd/branch     → test/e2e/branch_test.go
cmd/board      → test/e2e/board_test.go
cmd/filter     → test/e2e/filter_test.go
cmd/move       → test/e2e/workflow_test.go
cmd/sub        → test/e2e/workflow_test.go
cmd/create     → test/e2e/workflow_test.go
```

## Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| CI/CD integration | Future phase |
| Interactive prompt testing | Use `--skip-retro` and similar flags |
| `--config` flag | Temp directory approach sufficient |
| Testing `gh pmu init` | Write config directly in tests |

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Issue #551 | Reference | Bug that E2E would have caught |
| Issue #555 | Tracking | This proposal's tracking issue |
| Test Project #41 | Infrastructure | Must exist with fields configured |
| Test Repo | Infrastructure | `rubrical-works/gh-pmu-e2e-test` |
| Go 1.22+ | Technology | Required for build and coverage |

---

## Open Questions

None - proposal is comprehensive and ready for implementation.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Config discovery finds wrong file | Tests fail or affect real project | Use temp directory with `cmd.Dir` |
| Rate limiting | Tests slow or fail | Batch operations, add delays |
| Test pollution | Stale test data accumulates | `[E2E]` prefix, manual cleanup |
| Flaky network | Intermittent failures | Retry logic, longer timeouts |
| E2E gate slows releases | Longer release cycle | `--skip-e2e` flag for emergencies |
