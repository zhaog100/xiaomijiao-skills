# Microsprint and Deployment Workflows - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Author:** PRD generated from Proposal/Microsprint-Support-gh-pmu.md
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Milestone 1 complete; Milestone 2 superseded by PRD-Unified-Release-Branch.md)
**Framework:** IDPF-Structured (Moderate)

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

GitHub Projects Iterations are designed for traditional sprint cycles (1-4 weeks minimum). With AI-assisted development compressing work into hours rather than weeks, teams need a way to batch related work at a higher cadence. Additionally, IDPF-Structured and IDPF-LTS projects need version-based batching (releases and patches) rather than time-boxed iterations.

### Solution Overview

Add three workflow types to gh-pmu:

1. **Microsprints** - Hour-scale work batches for AI-assisted development (IDPF-Agile)
2. **Release workflows** - Version-based deployment batching (IDPF-Structured)
3. **Patch workflows** - Hotfix deployment batching (IDPF-LTS)

Each workflow uses tracker issues for state management and Text fields as the source of truth for issue assignment.

### Target Users

- Solo developers using AI-assisted development
- Small teams needing higher-cadence work batching
- Projects using IDPF-Structured or IDPF-LTS frameworks

### Success Criteria

- All Phase 1 acceptance criteria passing
- All Phase 2 acceptance criteria passing
- Code coverage targets met (50% for `cmd`, 80% for other new packages)
- Commands integrate seamlessly with existing gh-pmu patterns

## Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Impact |
|----|------------|--------|
| CON-001 | Git repository required | Artifact commands fail outside git repos |
| CON-002 | Text fields only | Avoids Single Select option pollution |
| CON-003 | One active tracker per workflow | Simplifies state management |
| CON-004 | No integration tests | Per stakeholder decision |

---

## Testing Approach

- **TDD:** Required for all development
- **Unit Tests:** Standard Go `testing` package
- **Table-Driven:** Where appropriate (existing pattern)
- **Mocked API:** No real GitHub API calls in tests
- **Integration Tests:** Not required
- **Coverage Target:** 50% for `cmd` package, 80% for other new packages
