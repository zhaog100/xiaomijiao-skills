**P**raxis **M**anagement **U**tility — a GitHub CLI extension for project workflows, sub-issue hierarchies, and batch operations.

> **Note:** gh-pmu is designed for **Kanban-style GitHub Projects** with status-based columns (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done). It integrates seamlessly with the [IDPF-Praxis](https://github.com/rubrical-works/idpf-praxis) framework for structured development workflows, but works standalone without any framework.

## Features

📋 **Project Management** - List, view, create, and update issues with project field values in one command

🔗 **Sub-Issue Hierarchy** - Create and manage parent-child issue relationships with progress tracking

⚡ **Batch Operations** - Intake untracked issues, triage with rules, split checklists into sub-issues

📊 **Board View** - Terminal Kanban board visualization

🚀 **Workflow Commands** - Branch management with artifact generation

🔄 **Cross-Repository** - Work with sub-issues across multiple repositories

## Installation

```bash
gh extension install rubrical-works/gh-pmu
```

## Upgrade

```bash
gh extension upgrade gh-pmu
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize configuration
gh pmu init

# List issues with project metadata
gh pmu list

# View issue with project fields and sub-issue progress
gh pmu view 42

# Update status
gh pmu move 42 --status in_progress

# Create sub-issue
gh pmu sub create --parent 42 --title "Subtask"

# Start a branch (release, patch, or feature workflow)
gh pmu branch start --name release/v1.2.0
gh pmu move 42 --branch current
gh pmu branch close
```

## Standalone Usage

`gh pmu` works as a standalone tool without any framework integration. The optional `framework` field in `.gh-pmu.yml` enables workflow restrictions when used with process frameworks like [IDPF](https://github.com/rubrical-works/idpf-praxis).

**Standalone (default):**
- All commands work normally
- No workflow routing or approval gates
- Simple project management

**With framework integration:**
- Adds workflow restrictions and checkpoint discipline
- Structured patterns (epic→story hierarchies)
- Domain specialist role system

To use standalone, simply omit the `framework` field from your config:

```yaml
project:
  owner: your-org
  number: 1
repositories:
  - your-org/your-repo
fields:
  status:
    values: {backlog, in_progress, in_review, done}
  priority:
    values: {p0, p1, p2}
```
